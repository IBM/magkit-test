/**
 * Utility class for creating and configuring Mockito mocks of JCR ObservationManager instances.
 * <p>
 * This utility class provides factory methods for creating pre-configured ObservationManager mocks
 * that can be used in unit tests for JCR-based applications. The class simplifies the process of
 * mocking JCR observation functionality by providing sensible defaults and allowing custom
 * configuration through stubbing operations.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The ObservationManager is a key component in JCR for handling repository events such as node
 * additions, removals, modifications, and property changes. This utility helps in testing code
 * that depends on observation functionality without requiring a full JCR repository setup.
 * </p>
 *
 * <h3>Key Features:</h3>
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Creates pre-configured ObservationManager mocks with default behavior</li>
 *   <li>Supports custom configuration through ObservationManagerStubbingOperation instances</li>
 *   <li>Automatically initializes registered event listeners collection</li>
 *   <li>Validates input parameters to prevent null pointer exceptions</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h3>Usage Examples:</h3>
 * <pre>{@code
 * // Create a basic ObservationManager mock with default behavior
 * ObservationManager observationManager = ObservationMockUtils.mockObservationManager();
 *
 * // Create an ObservationManager with custom event listener registration
 * EventListener listener = mock(EventListener.class);
 * ObservationManager observationManager = ObservationMockUtils.mockObservationManager(
 *     ObservationManagerStubbingOperation.stubEventListener(listener, Event.NODE_ADDED, "/content", true, null, null, false)
 * );
 *
 * // Multiple stubbing operations can be applied
 * ObservationManager observationManager = ObservationMockUtils.mockObservationManager(
 *     ObservationManagerStubbingOperation.stubEventListener(listener1, Event.NODE_ADDED, "/", true, null, null, false),
 *     ObservationManagerStubbingOperation.stubEventListener(listener2, Event.PROPERTY_CHANGED, "/content", false, null, null, true)
 * );
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <h3>Thread Safety:</h3>
 * <p>
 * This utility class is thread-safe as it only contains static methods and does not maintain
 * any shared state. However, the created mock instances themselves may not be thread-safe
 * depending on how they are configured and used in tests.
 * </p>

    /**
     * Creates a Mockito mock of ObservationManager with configurable stubbing operations.
     * <p>
     * This factory method creates a new ObservationManager mock instance with default behavior
     * and applies any provided stubbing operations to customize its behavior. The mock is
     * pre-configured with an empty collection of registered event listeners, which can be
     * modified through the provided stubbing operations.
     * </p>
     *
     * <h4>Default Behavior:</h4>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Registered event listeners collection is initialized as empty</li>
     *   <li>All other methods return Mockito's default values (null for objects, 0 for primitives)</li>
     *   <li>Methods can be further customized using the provided stubbing operations</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h4>Stubbing Operations:</h4>
     * <p>
     * The stubbing operations are applied in the order they are provided. Later operations
     * may override the behavior configured by earlier operations if they target the same
     * methods. Common stubbing operations include:
     * </p>
     * <ul>
     *   <li>Registering event listeners for specific event types and paths</li>
     *   <li>Configuring event listener removal behavior</li>
     *   <li>Setting up custom event dispatching logic</li>
     * </ul>
     *
     * <h4>Usage Examples:</h4>
     * <pre>{@code
     * // Basic ObservationManager without additional configuration
     * ObservationManager manager = mockObservationManager();
     *
     * // ObservationManager with pre-registered event listener
     * EventListener listener = mock(EventListener.class);
     * ObservationManager manager = mockObservationManager(
     *     ObservationManagerStubbingOperation.stubEventListener(
     *         listener, Event.NODE_ADDED, "/content", true, null, null, false
     *     )
     * );
     *
     * // ObservationManager with multiple event listeners
     * ObservationManager manager = mockObservationManager(
     *     ObservationManagerStubbingOperation.stubEventListener(listener1, Event.NODE_ADDED, "/", true, null, null, false),
     *     ObservationManagerStubbingOperation.stubEventListener(listener2, Event.PROPERTY_CHANGED, "/content", false, null, null, true),
     *     ObservationManagerStubbingOperation.stubRegisteredEventListeners(listener1, listener2)
     * );
     * }</pre>
     *
     * @param stubbings varargs array of ObservationManagerStubbingOperation instances to configure
     *                  the mock's behavior. These operations are applied in the order provided.
     *                  Can be empty to create a mock with only default behavior.
     * @return a new Mockito mock of ObservationManager configured with the specified stubbing operations
     * @throws RepositoryException never thrown in the current implementation, but declared to match
     *                           the JCR API signature for consistency with real ObservationManager usage
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the stubbings parameter is null
